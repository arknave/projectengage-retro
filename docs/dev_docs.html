        <h2> To-do list </h2>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implement useful keyboard shortcuts, that would quicken use. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Create a way for users to comment their code through the UI, maybe through highlights and text to the side.
        </li>
        <li>
          We need to have a dialog where users can create their own functions, and be able to reference them. 
        </li>  
        <li>
            Make a "view image" link (so people can download their creations!).
            This should be really easy by using canvas.toDataUrl().
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a system for submitting programs. This would require some
            server side stuff, but shouldn't be too dificult by utilizing the
            current export script functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
            Change the save format to store less information. Currently, when a
            program is saved, the code is saved along with it, so if there is a
            bugfix in the code for a block, the program does not receive the
            update. This can result in incredibly confusing bugs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently, when images are saved (with browser canvas saving
            functionality), the entire canvas is saved, rather than the part of
            the canvas with content in it. This often results in a large amount
            of white space arount the image. Make a save function that trims
            the canvas to only include non-transparent pixels
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a "modify variables" block which takes a variable and a new value
			and sets the variable equal to that value.			
        </li>
        <li>
            Some types, like the size and point types, feel redundant because
            they will only be immediatly used. Perhaps they should be done away
            with and replaced with integer arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
            There's a lot of messy stuff we have to do because the data behind
            blocks isn't coppied when a block is added to the script. It would
            be nicer if every instance of a block had its own copy of certain
            data objects like return and locals.
        </li>
        <li>
            "Labels" (and other things) are stored as strings when there really ought
            to be a label object. This has resulted in some pretty messy code, which 
            could be cleaned up.
        </li>
        <li>
            We need a better example video. The current one was chosen because
            it was the only public domain video I could find in a short amount
            of time. However, it is quite boring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add support for sound.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add more scratch stuff. Primarily we would be interested in adding
            sprites. Light development has been made and you can view it <a href = "http://www.github.com/arknave/LASAProjectEngage">here. </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Write more examples!
        </li>
