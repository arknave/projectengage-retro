      <h2> Basic tutorial </h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to project engage programming! This short tutorial will explain
        the basics of writing programs in this environment. In this tutorial,
        we will draw simple stripe pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you start the programming environment, you should see an empty
        space to build your program in, and a menu containing various blocks to
        build your program from. Start by opening the "Control" menu and
        drag the "when program runs" block into the workspace. This block
        will execute when the "Run" button is pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we will need a surface to build the pattern on. Open the
        variable menu and click the "make a variable" button. The first varaible type 
        we need is an imagedata, named Stripey. Set the starting values to 0 and 0.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we need to create our variable in the program so drag the 
        "create imagedata Stripey..." block under the when program runs. 
        And now in the big area we should have this.
      </p>
      <img src="tutorial_img/step1.png"/>
      <p>
        Then we can set "Stripey" to a width and height of 320. Next, we are going 
        to loop through every single pixel in the image data. First we are going to
        need counters that keep track of where we are in the loop. So create two new 
        number variables (indexInner, indexOuter), set them both to zero, 
        and drag them into the code.
        Now, add two repeat loops from the control menu to the bottom of
        your script. Put one inside the other. Set both of the slots to 320.
      </p>
      <img src="tutorial_img/step2.png"/>
      <p>
        Next we need to have our counters increment every time we run the loop.
        So drag a set block under each loop. For the first loop, we want to
        change the indexOuter by one so on the left side drag 
        the variable indexOuter, then on the right drag a "+" block from under the
        Math section. Then within this block the left should be an indexOuter and we
        should add 1 to it. Do the same for the inner loop for innexInner. Also we
        are going to need to reset the indexInner each time so right above the
        second loop set the indexInner to 0.
      </p>
      <img src="tutorial_img/step3.png"/>
      <p>
        For this program, we want to draw a burnt orange pixel 
        if the remainder of the
        x-index, indexInner, divided by 80 is less than 40. This will create a fourty
        pixel wide burnt orange stripe to occur every 40 pixels. 
        To do this, add an "if else"
        block from the control menu to the inside of your loops. Within the if
        statement slot, put a "&lt;" block from the math menu. On the right of
        the "&lt;" put "40". On the left, put a "mod" block from the math menu.
        In the left argument of the mod, put the loop index of the inner loop,
        indexInner.
        For the right argument, put "80". This will find the remainder when the
        indexInner is divided by 80, and check if it is less than fourty.
      </p>
      <img src="tutorial_img/step4.png"/>
      <p>
        We're almost done! If the x-index, indexInner, divided by 80 
        is less than 40, we should put a burnt orange pixel on the image data. 
        In the top section of the if
        statement, put a "put pixel" block from the image manipulation menu.
        For the first slot, put a "red _ green _ blue _" block from the image
        manipulation menu. Set the red to 203, green to 96, and blue to 21. 
        For the "to" argument of the put pixel block, put the image data
        we created at the beginning of this tutorial, Stripey. 
        For the point, add a point block from the point menu. 
        For the x argument of the point, put the
        loop index from our outer loop, indexOuter. For the y argument, 
        put the loop index from our inner loop, indexInner.  
        This will put a burnt orange pixel to the image if we are
        drawing a stripe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, put the exact same thing for the else slot of the if statement,
        except instead of burnt orange colors, put all three colors at zero.
        This will
        put a black pixel to the image data if we are not drawing a stripe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, after the loops, put a "draw imageData" block from the image
        manipulation menu. For the first argument, put the imagedata object we
        created at the beginning of this tutorial, Stripey. 
        For the point, put a point
        object from the point menu. Set both arguments on the point object to
        zero. The completed program should look like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        Now press run. If you did everything right, it should look like this:
      </p>

        If you have problems, check that you did everything right. Look at a <a

        this program.
